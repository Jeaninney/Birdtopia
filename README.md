User Story

AS an avid bird watcher 
I WANT a website to retrieve information about birds
SO THAT I can identify birds that I encounter.

GIVEN a website provide informaiton about local birds
WHEN the page loads it asks for my location
THEN I allow it to know my location
WHEN I click to begin
THEN I am prompted to give a number of birds to view
WHEN when I select more than 25 birds
THEN the site limits my selection to 25
WHEN I click "click"
THEN I am presented information about birds that are near my location
WHEN the bird information loads
THEN I am provided the name of the bird, a picture and 3 recordiing of that bird's sounds
